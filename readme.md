About me

My name is Chris and I am retiring from the U.S. Army as a Master Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician. I have 20 years of experience managing programs, finding solutions to dangerous problems, and leading Soldiers throughout the Pacific, Central, and European theaters of operations. I am attending CyberVets, a Cyber Security transition program, working hard to build another set of skills that will help me keep doing what I love: Protecting U.S. citizens and infrastructure.

Why Cyber?

Cyber Security is a natural progression for me, I have developed critical problem-solving skills in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. The price of failure is often unacceptable and the stakes are high. Cyber translates in both complexity and severity. It offers a dynamic problem set that I can leverage my experience against. The tools are often new and evolving but the mindset remains the same.

My Experience

I am a Senior NCO in the U.S. Army, stationed in Aberdeen Proving Grounds MD. I have maintained positions of increased scope and responsibility over my 20-year career. I have 15 years of experience managing teams in extreme environments all over the world. My duties include operating as an EOD team leader in Afghanistan, capability development for the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), and acting as an EOD subject matter expert for the U.S. European Command. I have extensive knowledge in the field of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (C-WMD). I have helped develop the U.S. Army's C-WMD training programs and policy.
